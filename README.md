# Algorithm and Data Structure Visualizer

https://visualiz.netlify.app/ 

Welcome to the **Algorithm and Data Structure Visualizer**, a web-based platform to help you learn and visualize various data structures and algorithms interactively. This tool provides a hands-on experience to explore the fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms, including linked lists, stacks, queues, and graph traversal like Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Features

### 1. Singly Linked List Visualizer
- **Interactive Visualization**: View functions like Push, Pop, Shift, Unshift, Set, Insert, Remove, Reverse in a singly linked list.
- **Real-time Updates**: See changes reflected immediately on the screen.
- **Highlights**: Understand how nodes are linked through "next" pointers.

### 2. Doubly Linked List Visualizer
- **Interactive Visualization**:View functions like Push, Pop, Shift, Unshift, Set, Insert, Remove, Reverse in a doubly linked list.
- **Bidirectional Navigation**: See "next" and "previous" pointers in action.

### 3. Stack Visualizer
- **LIFO Structure**: Learn how stacks work using the Last-In-First-Out principle.
- **Interactive Operations**:
  - Push: Add elements to the stack.
  - Pop: Remove elements from the top of the stack.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch elements being added or removed dynamically.

### 4. Queue Visualizer
- **FIFO Structure**: Explore the First-In-First-Out principle of queues.
- **Interactive Operations**:
  - Enqueue: Add elements to the back of the queue.
  - Dequeue: Remove elements from the front of the queue.
- **Visualization**: See the order of elements and how they flow through the queue.

### 5. Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualizer
- **Pathfinding Algorithm**: Learn how Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path in a weighted graph.
- **Features**:
  - **Start Node**: Drag the green start node to any position.
  - **End Node**: Drag the red end node to any position.
  - **Walls**: Click and drag to create impassable barriers on the grid.
  - **Weights**:
    - Toggle weight mode and assign weights to specific nodes.
    - Weighted nodes cost more to traverse compared to unweighted nodes.
  - **Shortest Path**: The algorithm highlights the shortest path in yellow after execution.
- **Visualization Steps**:
  - Nodes visited are shown dynamically as the algorithm progresses.
  - Real-time pathfinding visualization with animations.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (with Hooks)
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth visual transitions
- **Styling**: CSS for a clean and responsive UI
- **Hosting**: Deployed on [Netlify](https://visualiz.netlify.app/)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
